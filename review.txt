These are the extra review notes apart from the code.
Gitflow: the project uses gitflow correctly, although it mainly focuses on feature branches. I miss the use of release branches for better version management, and hotfix branches for urgent bug fixes in production.
Compose: the compose file is empty.
Bitnet: the whole folder has empty files.
API: the whole folder has empty files.
Yolo: the whole folder has empty files.
Please start developing your project.
